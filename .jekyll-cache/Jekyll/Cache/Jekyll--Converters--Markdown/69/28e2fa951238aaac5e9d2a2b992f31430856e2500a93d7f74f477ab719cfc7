I"P<p>Dear bird resting in my hand
I so admire your golden plumage,
Such dramatic attire; documentaries claim
Itâ€™s part of your mating game, except out here in the
Swampy reeds along this churning river, where fishermen
Sometimes wade
There are few females to impress.
I wonder if you gild your feathers just for
Aesthetic pleasure?</p>
